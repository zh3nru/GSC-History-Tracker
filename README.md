# **GSC History Tracker**

A centralized mobile app that provides a simplified browsing experience for specific historical events in General Santos City.

## **Overview**
This mobile app focuses on leveraging the use of various algorithms in handling data such as merge sort and binary search.
  1. Merge Sort - used in the filter function and the selection of categories. It sorts the data by specific criteria such as data, name, relevance, and category. The sorted data is then retrieved and displayed.
  2. Binary Search - used in the search bar. If data satisfies the user input, it will retrieve and display that data as the search result.
